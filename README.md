# Medical_X_ray_NLP_interpretation

We aim to design a new model to produce radiology reports based on chest X-ray images.

To extract features in chest X-ray images, we use the idea of Codeformer. We create codebooks in the process and match them with feature maps extracted by the CNN encoder.

To generate radiology report, we take GPT2 as our NLP model.#code will be uploaded in the future
